# Portfolio Site
I've been meaning to make my own custom portfolio site so that I'm not relying on carrd.co for any longer.

## 3D Support
- Three.js integration using Threlte!
- Some kind of funny 3D mascot character. (Might make into a chat agent in the future)

## 2D/3D Art Gallery
- 2D/3D art gallery that imports entries from .json files.
- Can swap between 2D and 3D view modes.
- 3D view navigates slightly differently.
- 3D models have turntable animations and can be paused.

## Projects
- Loading in project details from .json files.
- Project title, description and preview logo/images.
- Directs to the project's full page. (project must exist in '/routes/projects/projectname')

## Portfolio
- Explaining what I specialize in.
- Showcasing any paid work I've done, like 2D/3D art commissions.

## About/Info/Contact Page
- Personal information.
- Commission form(s).
- Contact information, maybe a preview of my latest tumblr/x.com post or something blog-like.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment
TBD
